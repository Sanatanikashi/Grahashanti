            Graha Shanti Puja is undertaken with the goal of reducing the negative effects of the planets that are malefic. It improves the positive energies of a person and the family performing this puja. The planets or grahas for whom this puja is performed are the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn and the two shadow planets Rahu and Ketu. These are called the Navagrahas.
            
            These Navgraha are the basis of all astrological or horoscopic calculations and predictions of a person.
